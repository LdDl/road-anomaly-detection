## About
This project is aimed to register road traffic accidents, foreign object and other anomaly situations on roads. It is pretty simple and uses just YOLO (both [traditional](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) and [Ultralytics version](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) could be used). Some advanced techniques like 3D-CNN, LSTM's and others could be used, but I do not have that much time so PR's are very welcome.
